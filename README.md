Zachary Lynch's code samples. 

These samples demonstrate some of my skills as a software developer.
Mainly machine learning, my skills primarily revolve around data analysis and data representation.
These programs are coded in Python, but I have skills with the Django framework, HTML/CSS, Java, MySQL, and Swift.
